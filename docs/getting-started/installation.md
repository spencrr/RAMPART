# Installation

## Requirements

- Python **≥ 3.11**
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or pip for package management

---

## Install RAMPART

### Using uv (recommended)

Create a virtual environment and install RAMPART:

```bash
uv init rampart-dev-env
cd rampart-dev-env
uv add rampart
```

Or, if you already have a project:

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install rampart
```

### Using pip

=== "Linux / macOS"

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install rampart
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"

    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install rampart
    ```

Both approaches install RAMPART and all dependencies, including [PyRIT](https://github.com/microsoft/PyRIT) v0.13.0.

---

## Install from Source

### Using uv

```bash
uv init rampart-dev-env
cd rampart-dev-env
uv add rampart --git https://github.com/microsoft/RAMPART.git
```

### Using pip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/RAMPART.git
cd RAMPART
pip install -e .
```

For development dependencies (linting, type checking, test tooling):

```bash
# uv (recommended — installs the dev group by default)
uv sync

# pip
pip install -e . --group dev
```

---

## Optional Extras

RAMPART's core install is intentionally small. Features that pull in heavy provider SDKs are exposed as optional extras:

| Extra | Pulls in | When you need it |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| `onedrive` | `msgraph-sdk`, `azure-identity` | Using the built-in [`OneDriveSurface`][rampart.surfaces.onedrive.OneDriveSurface] to plant XPIA payloads in OneDrive. |

Install one or more extras with the standard bracket syntax:

```bash
pip install "rampart[onedrive]"
# or from source:
pip install -e ".[onedrive]"
# or with uv:
uv add "rampart[onedrive]"
```

---

## Verify Installation

Confirm the RAMPART pytest plugin is registered by checking its markers:

=== "Linux / macOS"

    ```bash
    pytest --markers | grep -E "harm|trial"
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"

    ```powershell
    pytest --markers | Select-String "harm|trial"
    ```

Expected output:

```
@pytest.mark.harm(*categories): categorize by harm type
@pytest.mark.trial(n=, threshold=1.0): deprecated clone-based repetition
```

RAMPART registers as a pytest plugin automatically via the `pytest11` entry
point. No `conftest.py` configuration is needed to activate it. New statistical
tests use the public `execute_trials_async` helper; the marker remains only for
the `0.2.x` migration window and is removed in `0.3.0`.

## Setting Up Your Test Project

Your `pyproject.toml` should include:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "rampart",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=9.0",
    "pytest-asyncio>=1.3",
]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
```
