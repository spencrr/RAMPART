# Parallel Execution with pytest-xdist

RAMPART supports parallel test execution via `pytest-xdist`, producing a **single unified report** even when tests run across multiple worker processes.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install pytest-xdist
pytest -n 4
```

With `-n 4`, pytest spawns 4 worker processes that execute tests in parallel. RAMPART intercepts each worker's results, ships them to the controller process, and emits **one consolidated report** at the end of the session.

---

## How It Works

```

                │
                ▼
        Single unified TestRunReport
```

- **Workers** attach JSON-safe serialized [`Result`][rampart.core.result.Result] objects to each call-phase `TestReport`, or to a non-passing setup report when setup recorded Results and no call report will occur. Workers do **not** emit RAMPART report sinks.
- **Controller** receives each envelope through `pytest_runtest_logreport`, validates and merges it into its [`RampartSession`][rampart.pytest_plugin._session.RampartSession], and emits sinks once at session end.
- **Worker shutdown** carries only trial specifications and the expected number of streamed Result representations in `config.workeroutput`. The controller reconciles that count in `pytest_testnodedown`; Results are never delivered through both paths.

The normal transport boundary is the call phase, which includes Results recorded
during successful fixture setup. A failed or skipped setup that recorded Results
uses its setup report as a fallback because no call report follows. Results
recorded during fixture teardown are not streamed.

The result: **one** `JsonFileReportSink` output file, **one** call to `MyCustomSink.emit_async`, and accurate population statistics over the full result set.

---

## Trial Tests with xdist

`@pytest.mark.trial` declares population configuration but does not create pytest items, so it does not change xdist scheduling. A marked test runs on one worker like any other test and receives its effective values through `trial_config`.

Use `--rampart-trials=N` to change the population depth supplied to selected tests. Parallelizing the executions within a test is the responsibility of that test or its population-execution helper.

---

## Registering Sinks: the `pytest_rampart_sinks` hook

The **recommended** way to register report sinks is the `pytest_rampart_sinks`
hook. It is resolved on the controller — which never executes fixtures — so it
behaves identically in single-process and xdist runs, and (unlike the fixture
path) supports sinks that need configuration.

Implement it in your `conftest.py`:

```python
# conftest.py
from pathlib import Path

from rampart.reporting import JsonFileReportSink


def pytest_rampart_sinks(config):
    return [JsonFileReportSink(output_dir=Path(".report"))]
```

- Multiple implementations are supported; RAMPART emits to the **union** of every
  returned sink.
- An implementation may return an empty list to contribute none.
- Non-`ReportSink` items (or a non-list return) are dropped with a warning, so one
  malformed implementation cannot break emission.

If your sinks need dependencies, build them inside the hook — it receives the
`pytest.Config` and runs on the controller, so you can build sinks from `config`
values or environment variables there.

## Trust Boundary & Security

Worker payloads cross a process boundary via `execnet` and may contain attacker-controlled content (agent responses, payload text, evaluator rationale). RAMPART's serialization defends against:

- **Arbitrary code execution** — strict JSON-safe primitives only; no `pickle`, `marshal`, or custom `__reduce__`.
- **Schema drift** — payloads with missing or unknown schema versions are rejected fail-closed.
- **Memory exhaustion** — each serialized Result is capped at 16 MiB by default.
- **Terminal/log injection** — ANSI escape sequences are stripped from free-form text at the deserialization boundary.
- **Path traversal** — worker-local artifact paths are stored as opaque strings in metadata; the controller never accesses worker files.

The private worker envelope is `rampart.xdist.v3`. Version 3 marks the change
from prefix-folded probe status to terminal-trace status. Controllers reject
v2 payloads rather than interpreting their status under the wrong semantics.

### Size cap

The default 16 MiB cap can be overridden via the pytest CLI option or an ini setting:

```bash
pytest -n 4 --rampart-xdist-max-bytes=134217728
```

Or in `pytest.ini` / `pyproject.toml`:

```ini
[pytest]
rampart_xdist_max_bytes = 134217728
```

An oversized Result is replaced by an attributed ERROR/truncation marker while
normal Results from the same worker continue to stream. The controller records
the run as incomplete in `TestRunReport.metadata`. Configured limits below 4 KiB
use a 4 KiB effective minimum so the marker itself always fits.

Truncation markers preserve population provenance when it fits; otherwise,
`_rampart_population_ref_omitted` records its omission.

---

## Incomplete Runs

If a worker crashes, drops a streamed Result, omits its final count, or hits the
size cap, the controller marks the run as incomplete:

```python
report.metadata["incomplete"]            # True if any worker failed
report.metadata["incomplete_reasons"]    # list[str] — one per failure
```

Reports are still emitted with whatever data was collected. For safety-critical CI, sinks or post-processing should check the `incomplete` flag and fail the build accordingly.

Malformed worker results also mark the run incomplete without discarding
previously received results.

---

## Run-Mode Metadata

Reports produced under xdist include:

```python
report.metadata["xdist_active"]   # True
report.metadata["worker_count"]   # int
report.metadata["dist_mode"]      # "load", "loadgroup", etc.
```

---

## Durability behavior

Each eligible report is merged as it reaches the controller. If a worker is
killed mid-run, every Result already delivered remains in the final report and
the run is marked incomplete because the worker cannot provide a final expected
count. A clean worker shutdown publishes its emitted Result count; any mismatch
with the controller's received count detects a silent drop and also marks the run
incomplete.

The cap applies independently to each Result. An oversized transcript therefore
does not discard normal Results from that worker.

---

## Limitations

- Results recorded only during fixture teardown are outside the report-streaming
  boundary and are not included.
- A worker that dies can lose Results whose eligible reports had not reached
  the controller; already-streamed Results are retained and the run is marked
  incomplete (see [Durability behavior](#durability-behavior)).
- Mixed RAMPART versions across controller and workers are unsupported; install the
  same version everywhere.
- `pytest-xdist` itself does not support interactive debugging (`--pdb`, `--trace`);
  use single-process mode for debugging.
