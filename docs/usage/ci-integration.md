# CI Integration

RAMPART tests run as standard pytest tests. This guide covers patterns for CI pipelines.

---

## Running in CI

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

RAMPART tests interact with real or simulated agents and may take longer than unit tests. Set appropriate timeouts:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --timeout=300
```

### Parallel Execution

For faster CI runs, use [`pytest-xdist`](xdist.md):

```bash
pip install pytest-xdist
pytest tests/ -n auto
```

RAMPART aggregates results across worker processes and emits a single unified report under **any** `--dist` mode. The default `--dist=load` spreads `@trial` clones across all workers and is usually fastest. Add `--dist=loadgroup` only when a trial group needs to stay on one worker (e.g. clones share a session fixture or per-group worker state). See [Choosing `loadgroup` vs `load`](xdist.md#choosing-loadgroup-vs-load) for details and security considerations.

## Trial Markers for Statistical Confidence

Use `@pytest.mark.trial(n=, threshold=1.0)` for tests where a single run is not conclusive:

```python
@pytest.mark.trial(n=10, threshold=0.8)
async def test_injection_resistance(adapter):
    result = await Attacks.xpia(...).execute_async(adapter=adapter)
    assert result
```

This runs 10 independent trials. The test group passes only if ≥ 80% of trials are `SAFE`.

**Trial semantics in CI:**

- Each trial clone appears as a separate pytest item
- The aggregate verdict appears in the RAMPART terminal summary
- Any `UNSAFE` trial → the group fails
- `ERROR` trials count against the pass rate
- A clone that records no Result counts against the pass rate
- A failed aggregate changes an otherwise-successful pytest exit status to `1`

---

## Structured Reports

Register the `pytest_rampart_sinks` hook to write JSON reports for downstream processing:

```python
# conftest.py
from pathlib import Path

from rampart.reporting import JsonFileReportSink


def pytest_rampart_sinks(config):
    return [JsonFileReportSink(output_dir=Path(".report"))]
```

The JSON file contains aggregate statistics and per-result data that CI dashboards can consume. The hook is resolved on the controller, so it behaves identically in single-process and [`pytest-xdist`](xdist.md) CI runs. See [Registering Sinks](pytest-integration.md#pytest_rampart_sinks-hook).

!!! warning "Deprecated"
    The older `rampart_sinks` fixture still works but is deprecated and will be removed in `0.3.0`. Prefer the `pytest_rampart_sinks` hook above.

---

## Pytest Options

RAMPART is configured via pytest options and Python (sinks, adapters, payloads).

### `--rampart-xdist-max-bytes`

Maximum size in bytes of a worker's serialized result payload when running under [`pytest-xdist`](xdist.md). Defaults to `67108864` (64 MB). Workers that exceed the cap log a warning and the controller marks the run as incomplete. Also configurable via the `rampart_xdist_max_bytes` ini option.

```bash
pytest -n auto --rampart-xdist-max-bytes=134217728   # 128 MB
```

---

## Environment Variables

Your adapter and test configuration typically read environment variables. Setting them locally for ad-hoc runs:

=== "Linux / macOS"

    ```bash
    export AGENT_API_KEY="..."
    export AGENT_ENDPOINT="https://..."
    pytest tests/
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"

    ```powershell
    $env:AGENT_API_KEY = "..."
    $env:AGENT_ENDPOINT = "https://..."
    pytest tests/
    ```

Then consume them in your adapter and configuration:

```python
import os
from rampart.core.llm import LLMConfig

@pytest.fixture
def adapter():
    return MyAdapter(
        api_key=os.environ["AGENT_API_KEY"],
        endpoint=os.environ["AGENT_ENDPOINT"],
    )

# For LLM-driven attacks
llm = LLMConfig(
    model="gpt-4o",
    endpoint=os.environ["OPENAI_ENDPOINT"],
    api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),  # None → azure-identity
    deployment=os.environ.get("OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT"),
)
```

## Exit Codes

RAMPART preserves existing nonzero pytest exit codes. If pytest would otherwise
exit successfully, RAMPART changes the status to `1` when a trial aggregate
fails or an xdist run is incomplete. Collect-only runs do not evaluate trial
gates.

| Exit Code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | All tests passed |
| `1` | Tests failed, a RAMPART trial gate failed, or the run was incomplete |
| `2` | Test execution interrupted |
| `3` | Internal pytest error |
| `4` | Pytest usage or configuration error, including invalid RAMPART marker values |
| `5` | No tests collected |
