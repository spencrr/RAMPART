    handlers manually, a single factory is registered once at startup and

    Lifecycle:
        1. The pytest plugin calls ``register_default_handler_factory(factory)``

           fresh list of handlers, which are prepended to any user-supplied
           handlers.
        3. The plugin calls ``clear_default_handler_factory()`` during
           ``pytest_unconfigure`` to remove the factory.
