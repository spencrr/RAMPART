"""LLMDriver — LLM-backed prompt driver.

Wraps a PyRIT PromptChatTarget to generate the next user prompt on
each turn. The driver maintains two related conversations:

  - The **driver-side conversation** with the driving LLM, stored in
    PyRIT's CentralMemory keyed by self._conversation_id. Each turn
    consists of a framework-built user message (containing the latest
    agent response and evaluator feedback) and the LLM's next-prompt
    reply.

  - The **agent-side conversation** with the agent under test,
    represented by the ``history: list[Turn]`` passed into
    ``next_prompt_async`` by the execution loop.

These are linked by a derivation invariant: every user turn in the
driver-side conversation is built from the agent-side history at the
time of that call. The driver enforces this invariant on each call;
desync raises DriverError.

One driver instance = one driver-side conversation. Construct a new
driver per test. Use ``from_target`` for custom targets.

    the next prompt to send to the target agent.

    ``DriverError`` rather than returning None.
