class XPIAExecution(BaseExecution):
    """Executes the full XPIA attack lifecycle.

    Inherits BaseExecution.  Implements ``_execute_async`` with XPIA's
    specific phase structure.  The lifecycle skeleton (event dispatch,
    result collection, timing, infrastructure error handling) is owned
    by BaseExecution.

    Phases (delegated to private helpers from ``_execute_async``):
        1. Activate all injection handles (via AsyncExitStack).
        2. Wait for indexing (concurrent per-handle).
        3. Create session (via async context manager).
        4. Drive the trigger conversation via the PromptDriver.
        5. Apply an optional online stop condition while driving turns.
        6. Evaluate the terminal trace once.
        7. Cleanup session and injections (guaranteed via AsyncExitStack).
        8. Build and return Result via direct attack polarity.

    InfrastructureError raised by surfaces or adapters during any phase
    is caught by ``BaseExecution.execute_async`` (not here) and converted
    to ``Result(status=SafetyStatus.ERROR)``.  This execution strategy
    does not handle infrastructure failures — the base class does it as
    a cross-cutting concern for all strategies.

    Args:
        handles (list[InjectionHandle]): Prepared injections to activate.
            Empty for inline XPIA where payloads travel as chat
            attachments.
        driver (PromptDriver): How to drive the trigger conversation.
        evaluator (Evaluator): What condition to check for.
        stop_when (Evaluator | None): Optional online condition that stops the
            trace when detected.
        max_turns (int): Maximum prompt-response exchanges. Reaching the
            limit resolves the trace normally and prevents unbounded loops.
        event_handlers (list[ExecutionEventHandler] | None): Additional
            handlers beyond the framework defaults.
