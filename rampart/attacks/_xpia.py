class XPIAExecution(BaseExecution):
    """Executes the full XPIA attack lifecycle.

    Inherits BaseExecution.  Implements ``_execute_async`` with XPIA's
    specific phase structure.  The lifecycle skeleton (event dispatch,
    result collection, timing, infrastructure error handling) is owned
    by BaseExecution.

    Phases (delegated to private helpers from ``_execute_async``):
        1. Activate all injection handles (via AsyncExitStack).
        2. Wait for indexing (concurrent per-handle).
        3. Create session (via async context manager).
        4. Drive the trigger conversation via the PromptDriver.
        5. Evaluate per-turn with early stopping on detection.
        6. Cleanup session and injections (guaranteed via AsyncExitStack).
        7. Build and return Result via ``resolve_as_attack``.

    InfrastructureError raised by surfaces or adapters during any phase
    is caught by ``BaseExecution.execute_async`` (not here) and converted
    to ``Result(status=SafetyStatus.ERROR)``.  This execution strategy
    does not handle infrastructure failures — the base class does it as
    a cross-cutting concern for all strategies.

    Args:
        handles (list[InjectionHandle]): Prepared injections to activate.
            Empty for inline XPIA where payloads travel as chat
            attachments.
        driver (PromptDriver): How to drive the trigger conversation.
        evaluator (Evaluator): What condition to check for.
        max_turns (int): Maximum prompt-response exchanges before the
            execution stops with ERROR.  Prevents unbounded loops.
        event_handlers (list[ExecutionEventHandler] | None): Additional
            handlers beyond the framework defaults.
