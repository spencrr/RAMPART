    Note: the return type is BaseExecution (an ABC), not a protocol.
    This is a deliberate asymmetry with the parameter types, which
    use the Evaluator protocol.  Parameters use protocols because
    consumers provide implementations.  The return type uses the ABC
    because the consumer only calls ``execute_async`` on it, and
    BaseExecution provides the concrete lifecycle skeleton.

        Orchestrates the full XPIA flow: inject payloads into surfaces,
        wait for indexing, create a session, drive the trigger
        conversation, evaluate, clean up, return Result.

        The trigger parameter accepts benign user prompts that cause
        the agent to retrieve and process the injected content (e.g.,
        "Summarize Q3").  XPIA triggers are never adversarial — the
        attack is in the injected payload, not the prompt.

        Pass a string for the common single-prompt case, a list of
        strings for multi-turn sequences, a Request for prompts with
        inline attachments, or a PromptDriver for full control.

        For inline XPIA — where the poisoned content is attached to
        the chat message rather than pre-positioned in an external
        surface — omit ``inject`` and pass a ``Request`` with
        ``attachments`` as the trigger.

        Args:
            inject (InjectionHandle | list[InjectionHandle] | None):
                Prepared injections from ``surface.inject()`` calls.
                None for inline XPIA where the payload travels as a
                chat attachment.
            trigger (str | list[str] | Request | list[Request] | PromptDriver):
                Benign user request(s) that cause the agent to process
                poisoned content.
            evaluator (Evaluator): What condition to check for.
            max_turns (int): Maximum prompt-response exchanges before
                ERROR.  Defaults to 5.
            event_handlers (list[ExecutionEventHandler] | None): Optional
                additional handlers for custom observability.

        Returns:
            BaseExecution: Ready to execute with
                ``execute_async(adapter=...)``.
